# Movie Genre Prediction Model



## Overview

Welcome to the Movie Genre Prediction Model project! This machine learning project aims to predict the genre of a movie based on its description using  Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 82%.

## Features

- **Genre Prediction:** Accurately predicts the genre of a movie.
- **SVM Model:** Implements a Support Vector Machine model for classification.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple input interface for users to get genre predictions.

## How It Works

1. **Input:** Users enter a movie description.
2. **Processing:** The trained model analyze and understand the input.
3. **Prediction:** SVM predicts the most likely genre based on learned patterns.
